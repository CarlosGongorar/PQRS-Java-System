# PQRS-Java-System
This was my second project for advanced programming where we used Java to make a PQRS filing system.

## Technologies
The exercise was about making a PQRS system where a server sent execution threads to the clients who wanted to file a PQRS. The registered requests are saved in a database. And we apply MVC Model.

The technologies used are:
<ul>
<li>DerbyClient</li>
<li>Sockets</li>
<li>Threads</li>
<li>Properties Files</li>
